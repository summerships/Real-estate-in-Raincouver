Random stuff about rental market and real-estate in Metro-Vancouver area in Canada.

Raincouver real-estate market is starting to become really HOT and CRAZY. I'm suspecting that it's related to the influx of population. I can clearly feel that the population is increasing in some neighbourhoods which makes the schools reach their full capacity. Even the costco is more busier and more crowded. 

Too many high-rise buidlings, but too few supermarkets, hospitals, clinics, or schools. The expanding is out of propotion.
